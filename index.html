 <h2>Jahnea Francis</h2>
 <p>I am a second year Software Enginneering major. My interests span a diverse range from exploring the culinary world, savoring new dishes, and cherishing those moments of much-needed rest, to embarking on thrilling adventures. Nevertheless, my heart truly beats for entrepreneurship, as evidenced by my fervor for my clothing business. In my leisure hours, I'm constantly brainstorming ways to revamp and expand my enterprise. . What fuels my enthusiasm for web development is how it directly ties into enhancing my business's online presence. Crafting a compelling and user-friendly website for my clothing venture is a priority, as it can drive sales and customer engagement. I'm on a quest to reignite my passion for coding, and I eagerly anticipate where this fusion of technology and entrepreneurship will lead me in the future. </p>
